# TASKS: align-jp1-v13-parameter-and-command-reference

## Sync Rule

- Update this file in the same commit whenever one task or follow-up is
  completed, re-scoped, or intentionally dropped.
- If that change affects branch priorities or repository sequencing, update
  `docs/specs/plans.md` and `docs/specs/roadmap.md` in the same commit.

## Completed

- [x] Record JP1/AJS3 version 13 as the target reference for parameter parsing
      and command generation
- [x] Record that command generation should be separated from
      `buildUnitDefinition.ts`

## Remaining Follow-up

- [x] Inventory current parameter semantics that already match the version 13
      definition reference
- [x] Inventory current command-generation behavior and its coupling to
      show-unit-definition
- [x] Decide the first supported set of auto-generated `ajs` commands
- [x] Define how manual mismatches are tracked and closed incrementally

## Next Slice

- [ ] Extract the current `ajsshow` and `ajsprint` generation logic from
      `buildUnitDefinition.ts` into a dedicated application-facing seam while
      preserving the existing dialog DTO behavior
- [ ] Turn the audit notes into an explicit parameter-coverage matrix only when
      a behavior-changing alignment slice needs per-key status beyond the
      current audit summary

## Notes

- 2026-04-18: normative parameter and command sources were fixed to the user
  supplied JP1/AJS3 version 13 reference documents.
- 2026-04-20: the initial audit is recorded in `AUDIT.md`. Current parameter
  semantics are already centralized mainly in `parameterHelpers.ts`,
  `Defaults.ts`, and the builder families behind `ParamFactory`, while command
  generation is still embedded in
  `src/application/unit-definition/buildUnitDefinition.ts`.
- 2026-04-20: the first extracted supported command set will preserve the
  current user-visible behavior only: `ajsshow` and `ajsprint`.
