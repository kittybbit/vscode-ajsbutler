# PLANS.md

## Purpose

Track non-trivial changes using the repository's SDD workflow before
implementation.

This file is the high-level index for the per-feature plan structure in
`docs/specs/features/<feature>/`.

## Branch Status

### Completed In This Branch

- `BuildUnitList` use case exists and is covered by
  `src/test/suite/buildUnitList.test.ts`.
- `BuildUnitListView` exists and the table column groups now read application
  view data for `group1` to `group19`, and the table presentation now consumes
  `UnitListRowView` end to end.
- `ExportUnitListCsv` use case exists and is covered by
  `src/test/suite/exportUnitListCsv.test.ts`.
- `BuildFlowGraph` use case exists and is covered by
  `src/test/suite/buildFlowGraphUseCase.test.ts`, and the flow presentation
  no longer reconstructs `UnitEntity` to render, navigate, or open dialog data.
- `ShowUnitDefinition` now uses an application DTO instead of passing
  `UnitEntity` directly into the dialog.
- editor feedback extraction exists and is covered by
  `src/test/suite/buildSyntaxDiagnostics.test.ts` and
  `src/test/suite/findParameterHover.test.ts`.
- telemetry port extraction exists and is covered by
  `src/test/suite/reportWebviewOperation.test.ts`.
- normalized AJS model exists and is covered by
  `src/test/suite/normalizeAjsDocument.test.ts`.
- normalized AJS navigation helpers now expose parent lookup, ancestor lookup,
  and root jobnet lookup without reusing wrapper traversal in consumers.
- normalized AJS helpers now expose direct parameter lookup, repeated-value
  lookup, and first-ancestor inherited parameter lookup so application slices
  stop repeating wrapper-era parameter traversal logic.
- repeatable web-extension verification exists via `npm run test:web`.

### Next Priority Tasks

1. Continue moving the remaining wrapper-derived parameter semantics that still
   require rule-aware defaults or typed wrapper interpretation out of
   `ParameterFactory` in small slices.
2. Continue reducing activation and webview concentration without changing user
   behavior or breaking web-extension support.
3. Keep roadmap and feature task files aligned with merged slices so remaining
   debt stays explicit.

## Default Workflow

1. Create a dedicated git branch before implementation work starts.
2. Read the relevant documents in `docs/specs/`.
3. Update or create the related use-case spec in
   `docs/requirements/use-cases/`.
4. Create or update corresponding feature docs in
   `docs/specs/features/<feature>/`:
   - `SPECS.md` for implementation requirements
   - `PLANS.md` for planning and milestones
   - `TASKS.md` for execution items
5. Fill in assumptions explicitly when requirements are ambiguous.
6. Implement only after acceptance criteria are clear.
7. Before `git push`, confirm `npm run qlty`, `npm test`, and
   `npm run build` all pass.
8. Run any additional task-specific checks such as `npm run test:web`.
9. Summarize compatibility risks and follow-up work.

## Task Template

### Task

<!-- A single sentence describing what will be changed. -->

### Why

<!-- Why this change is necessary. -->

### Scope

<!-- Target files, modules, or use cases for the change. -->

### Non-Goals

<!-- What is out of scope for this task. -->

### Constraints

- Keep `engines.vscode` compatibility unless explicitly approved.
- Keep desktop and web extension behavior intact.
- Avoid direct `vscode` dependency in domain.
- Start implementation from a dedicated git branch, not directly on `main`.
- Do not `git push` until `npm run qlty`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`
  have all passed locally.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] build passes

- [ ] tests updated
- [ ] `git push` happens only after local `npm run qlty`, `npm test`, and
      `npm run build` pass
- [ ] desktop behavior preserved
- [ ] web behavior preserved if affected

## Current Task

### Task

Extract reusable rule-aware parameter helpers from `ParameterFactory` so the
remaining wrapper-derived parameter semantics can move in smaller slices.

### Why

`ParameterFactory` still concentrates lookup, inheritance, defaulting, and
SD-rule alignment behavior in one large module. Pulling the shared helper logic
out first makes the next semantic cleanup slices smaller and easier to review.

### Scope

- extract reusable parameter lookup and fallback helpers into a dedicated module
- extract reusable SD-rule alignment helpers into a dedicated module
- keep public `ParamFactory` behavior unchanged while switching it to the
  extracted helpers
- add focused tests for helper behavior

### Non-Goals

- changing parser output
- changing user-visible unit list, flow, or CSV behavior
- rewriting all parameter semantics at once
- changing extension activation, diagnostics, or telemetry

### Constraints

- Keep desktop and browser builds working.
- Keep `domain` and `application` free of direct `vscode` imports.
- Preserve current parser, list, flow, CSV, diagnostics, hover, and telemetry
  behavior.

### Design

#### Use case

Parameter helper extraction for remaining `ParameterFactory` cleanup.

#### Layers affected

- domain: parameter helper extraction
- docs: plan tracking for the extracted helper slice

#### Key decisions

- Extract helper logic without changing the public `ParamFactory` API.
- Keep semantic behavior identical and limit the slice to lookup/defaulting and
  SD-rule alignment helpers.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] shared helper module exists for parameter lookup/defaulting
- [ ] shared helper module exists for SD-rule alignment
- [ ] `ParamFactory` delegates to the extracted helpers without behavior changes
- [ ] focused tests cover helper behavior

### Test Plan

- run quality checks
- run desktop tests
- run build

### Risks

- helper extraction could accidentally change inherited/default parameter
  precedence
- helper extraction could accidentally change SD-rule alignment order or
  fallback generation

### Rollback Plan

- revert the helper-module extraction and return the logic to `ParamFactory`
- keep later semantic moves separate from this extraction step
